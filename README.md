#Decision Tree: A Tree-Based Algorithm in Machine Learning
##Tree have a very close connection with almostevery Computer Science domain, and Machine Learnung is not an exception here.We might be aware of the flowchars that we use to make decisions.For example,if the atmospheric temperature is < 15,take a bath,otherwise not.In the same way , industry experts try to form some business decision rules using tree-;ike flowcharts.Using Machine Learning,we try to automate this formation of the flowchart,which will be later used for predictions or taking decision tree is one such algorithm.
##A Decision Tree is a hierarchical breakdown of a dataset from the root node to the leaf node based on the governing attributes to solve a classification or regression problem.
##Decision Trees are a non-paramentric supervised learning algorithm that predicts the value of target variable by learning rules inferred from the data features.
##let's take a very popular dataset of PlayTennis and follow the formation of a flowchart.Here the objective of this flowchart would be to decide whether tennis play will happen or not based on the outlook,temperature,humidity,and wind conditions.
